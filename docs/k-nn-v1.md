#### [](#header-4) Getting started: the travelling salesman problem 

The original travelling salesman problem tries to came up with an answer for this question: _"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"_ 

This problem has multiple ways of answering it, and the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)  is actually a good start for an overview of all the possibilities.
